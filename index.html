                <p>Madison Blackstone is a director of brand marketing, with experience managing global teams and multimillion-dollar campaigns. Her background in brand strategy, visual design, and account management informs her mindful but competitive approach. Madison is fueled by her passion for understanding the nuances of cross-cultural advertising. She considers herself a "forever student," eager to both build on her academic foundations in psychology and sociology, and stays in tune with the latest digital marketing strategies through continued coursework.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Madison's hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to her most recent success at Rockwell Group, where she led international, award-winning campaigns for heavy-hitting brands, such as Puma, Gucci, and Rolex. Meanwhile, she vastly improved the productivity of her team by implementing strategic project management methods and ensuring a work-life balance for her department.
                    
                    Madison believes mindfulness in the workplace is key to successâ€”a tenet she lives out through her interests in yoga, meditation, gardening, and painting. Madison is currently working as a freelance marketing director and is always interested in a challenge.
